# Crowdfunding Smart Contract

This smart contract is a simplified crowdfunding platform that allows public funders to fund projects. There are a few stakeholders in this scenario. There is the fund owner and the investors. The fund owner is in charge of the handling of the funds. 

# View Crowdfunding Campaign Status

The smart contract allows users to view if the goal for crowdfunding has been achieved or not. 

There are two outcomes that the owner of the crowdfunding campaign can achieve:

1. Success: This means that the current balance is more than the targetFunds. The crowdfunding campaign is a success and the owner can withdraw the funds.
2. Failed:  This means that the current balance is less than the targetFunds. The crowdfunding campaign is not yet complete and the owner can choose to extend the deadline of the fund.
